```

### 🚨 **PROBLEMS THAT WERE BREAKING THE AGENT**

## **Issue #1: No Date Ordering** 
**Problem:** `get_recoveries()` function returned workouts in random database order
- Agent asking for "latest" workout was getting random 2023 data
- No `ORDER BY` clause = unpredictable results

**Fix:** Added `ORDER BY created_at DESC` to always return newest first

## **Issue #2: Date Filtering Not Implemented**
**Problem:** CRUD functions ignored date parameters completely
- Agent requesting "2025 data" got random years mixed together  
- Date filtering existed in API layer but wasn't passed to database

**Fix:** Implemented proper date filtering in all CRUD functions

## **Issue #3: Confusing Function Names**
**Problem:** Function called `get_recoveries()` actually returns workouts
- Misleading name from historical reasons
- Added documentation to clarify

## 🔧 **SPECIFIC FIXES APPLIED**

### **Updated CRUD Functions** (`whoop_data/crud/workout.py`)
```python
# BEFORE (broken)
def get_recoveries(db: Session, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):
    return db.query(Workout).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()

# AFTER (fixed) 
def get_recoveries(db: Session, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10, 
                  start_date: Optional[datetime] = None, end_date: Optional[datetime] = None):
    query = db.query(Workout)
    
    if start_date:
        query = query.filter(Workout.created_at >= start_date)
    if end_date:
        query = query.filter(Workout.created_at <= end_date)
    
    return query.order_by(Workout.created_at.desc()).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
```

### **Updated API Routes** (`whoop_data/api/workout_routes.py`)
- Added date parameter parsing from query strings
- Passed parsed dates to CRUD functions
- Applied to all workout endpoints (general, running, tennis)

### **Sports Mapping Available**
- Found your sports mapping JSON with 100+ sport types
- Running = ID 0, Tennis = ID 34, Walking = ID 63, etc.
